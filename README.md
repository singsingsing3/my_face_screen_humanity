# my_face_screen_humanity!
my face has become screen humanity!(called in Korean '인간극장')

## what is the 'screen humanity? (called in Korean '인간극장')
- It's a very famous Korean documentary TV show.
- It is famous for opening video with white line and black background so I was inspired on this.
- real screen humanity opening image is here.(for your understanding)
